Both the web server and the backend needs to be exposed to perform directory traversal defaults to port '80' for the web and port 1337 for the backend.

Otherwise it is ready set go with the .env file and `docker-compose up`.

One hosted instance with the real flag is nessary for the challenge.

Perhaps comment out the env_file in the docker-compose for the actual handout.
